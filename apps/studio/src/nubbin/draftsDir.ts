 * Where the studio's drafts survive a restart: a gitignored directory beside the app, one
 * file per route, overwritten in place. This is the autosave slot: the only mutable,
 * high-frequency write in an otherwise append-only design, and deliberately not
 * the authoring store: no history, no version append, no locks, no interface anyone else
 * implements. What that store's contract looks like is still the open design question #11
 * tracks, and this slot must not preempt it.
 *
 * The environment override exists because tests run in parallel files that must not share
 * one directory; the studio itself never sets it.
