summary: What core may depend on and how adapters plug in without coupling to it

# Package boundaries

> **`core` computes and depends on nothing. Adapters do IO. Consumers replace adapters, never `core`.**

## Why

The pitch is "bring your own integration". That is only true if the contract package is
genuinely portable — the moment `core` imports React, Next, or `node:fs`, it stops running
in the places it needs to run (a browser-side studio validating a draft, a worker compiling
an artifact, a CI step checking published content against a changed schema).

## Rules

### `core` imports nothing but Standard Schema

```ts
// WRONG — core is now unusable in a browser and coupled to a framework
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

// CORRECT — the caller supplies the value; core only computes over it
export async function compile(document: Document, catalog: Catalog): Promise<Artifact>
```

Component types reach `core` as a generic parameter, never as an import. That keeps
`defineBlock` type-safe in React without `core` knowing React exists.

### IO lives behind an injected contract

Storage, optional identity and access policy, assets, networking, and collaboration enter
through a public interface or callback. A domain-wide contract belongs in `core`; a
surface-specific effect belongs in that surface's headless package. Implementations live in
adapter packages or the consuming host. `core` never performs IO; it returns a value the
caller persists.

```ts
// CORRECT — the contract lives in core, the implementation does not
export interface ArtifactStore {
  read(hash: string): Promise<Artifact | null>;
  write(artifact: Artifact): Promise<void>;
  manifest(): Promise<Manifest>;
  publish(route: string, hash: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

An adapter is complete when it can be swapped for an in-memory implementation in tests
without changing a caller.

### Framework packages depend on `core`, never on each other

`@nubbin/react` and `@nubbin/next` both depend on `@nubbin/core`.
`next` may depend on `react`. Nothing depends upward, and no adapter depends on another
adapter.

### React and Next are peer dependencies

A consumer brings their own. Declare them in `peerDependencies` and `devDependencies`,
never `dependencies` — bundling a second React copy breaks hooks in ways that surface as
unrelated runtime errors.

### The published surface is the `exports` map

No deep imports. If a consumer needs something, export it from `src/index.ts`; if it
shouldn't be public, it shouldn't be reachable. Deep-import paths become a de-facto API
that semver can't protect.

## Gates

`dependency-cruiser` is the whole of it: `core` importing a framework or a `node:` builtin fails
the build, as does an adapter importing another adapter, or anything reaching past a package's
entry point. **Gate:** none for a self-contained reimplementation — a module that copies `core`'s
hashing rather than importing it passes every structural check, which is why
[`adapters.md`](adapters.md) states that separately.

## Checklist

- [ ] `packages/core/src/**` imports only `@standard-schema/spec` and its own modules
- [ ] New IO is an injected public contract at the narrowest package boundary
- [ ] Implementations live in an adapter package or the consuming host
- [ ] `react` / `react-dom` / `next` appear in `peerDependencies`, not `dependencies`
- [ ] Anything a consumer needs is exported from the package's `src/index.ts`
- [ ] No package imports a sibling adapter
