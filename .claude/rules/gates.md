# Gates

> **A repository invariant is a vitest test; a general-purpose concern is a maintained tool. Nothing in between — and a gate you have not watched fail is a gate you have not tested.**

## Why

A gate that passes because it scanned zero files reads exactly like one that passed. Nine gates in this repository reported success while checking nothing, and every one was found long after it shipped:

| Gate | What it was actually doing |
|---|---|
| the vendor-reference scanner | `walk()` only handled directories, so top-level files were never scanned |
| its term list | gitignored and absent, so it ran with zero terms |
| three scanners | omitted `examples/` from `SCAN_ROOTS`, and each carried an extension list narrower than its documented row, so a machine path in an `.svg`, a `.css` or an `.html` sat under a green tick |
| the file-reference and one-unit scanners | one's five roots omitted `apps/` and `examples/`; the others accepted only explicit paths, so `verify` ran them against nothing |
| `core-imports-no-framework` | matched a resolved `node_modules` path that never occurs, so the rule guarding the central invariant had never fired |
| `publint`, `attw` | installed, documented as gates, wired to nothing |
| the skills lockfile gate | compared names and ignored the content hash it stores |

None was carelessness. Each looked right and printed a tick.

## Rules

### Seed the failure, in both directions

```bash
# WRONG — the gate passes, so it works
pnpm boundaries          # ✔ no dependency violations found

# CORRECT — make the violation it exists to catch, and watch it fire
printf 'import { compile } from "../../../../packages/core/src/compile";\n' >> examples/demo/src/blocks/Hero.tsx
pnpm boundaries          # error no-deep-package-imports: examples/demo/… → packages/core/…
git checkout -- examples/demo/src/blocks/Hero.tsx
pnpm boundaries          # ✔ clean again
```

Both directions matter. A gate narrowed to remove a false positive must still fire on the true one, and a gate widened must still pass on a clean tree.

**Gate:** none — this is judgment. The pull request template carries it as a checklist item.

### The runner owns the verdict

Write a repository invariant as a test in `tests/`, never as a script that decides its own exit
code. Every failure above is a version of choosing wrong: printing a report and exiting 0,
exiting 0 having read no files, or being invoked under a name the package manager claimed — as
`pnpm docs` was, opening a homepage and exiting 0 while `verify` skipped documentation entirely.
A test has no exit code to choose, and a suite that ran nothing reports zero tests.

Write each as a pair: a fixture proving the detector fires, and an assertion over the repository
that also asserts its corpus size, so reading nothing fails. The fixture is the seeded violation
kept permanently, so a detector that stops detecting fails there rather than passing over the
corpus. A general-purpose concern goes to a maintained tool instead — `syncpack`, `jscpd`,
`knip` — because something that already exists is something nobody here keeps honest.

### Seed every form of the thing, not the convenient one

A pattern that catches one spelling and misses another is the failure above wearing a fix.

- A bare specifier and a resolved `node_modules` path are different strings. Where the dependency is not installed in the package under test, only the bare form ever occurs — which is exactly the import the rule exists to reject.
- Node builtins are not matched by a `^node:` path pattern at all. dependency-cruiser classifies them by `dependencyTypes: ["core"]`, and a path pattern silently matches nothing.

### The check needs checking before its output means anything

A verification that measures the wrong thing, or the right thing at the wrong moment, produces a
confident and specific number. It reads exactly like a correct one. Six in a single session:

| The check said | What was actually wrong |
|---|---|
| `intermediate frames: 15 … FAIL` | the pass condition treated a spring overshoot — 65px settling to 62px — as a failure |
| `ghost misaligned by 153px` | measured after scrolling past, once the exit observer had cleared the state. A CSS fix was written for an invented cause and changed nothing |
| `PASS — it loops` | asserted the timer had fired, not that anything moved. It fired, the rewind took two frames against an 850ms transition, and nothing visibly replayed |
| `collapses observed: 0` | required two adjacent samples to straddle the drop, which an 850ms transition sampled every 120ms never does |
| four gates unreachable | the walker's `[a-z-]+` cannot match `a11y`, so it could not see a gate that was wired in fine |
| `auto-close is broken` | every issue was hand-closed 2-9 minutes after its merge, before the observed 47-49s close could fire. The absence of an automatic close was then cited as proof one would never come |

Four rules follow. **Assert on the thing, not a proxy.** **Fix the measurement before writing a
second fix**: a change that alters nothing is evidence about the instrument. **Assert on shape,
not an exact figure**, where physics is involved. And **a check that changes what it measures
cannot report a negative.**

**Gate:** none — a check that lies passes every gate. This is the judgment `verify` cannot hold.

### A scanner's scope is asked of git, not listed

A gate that enumerates extensions or directories is blind to every file type nobody thought of
when the list was written, and the blindness is silent — the tick over the files it did read is
indistinguishable from a complete one. `tests/support/trackedFiles.mjs` asks `git ls-files` for
everything committed plus everything untracked and not ignored, which is exactly the set a
contributor is about to publish; a scanner needing a narrower slice filters that set down
rather than building its own. It throws instead of falling back to a directory walk, because a
fallback nobody exercises is where a gate quietly stops reading anything. **Gate:** none — this
is how a scanner is built, which no gate over the scanner can see.

### Say what the gate cannot catch

Claiming full coverage is how the next gap is missed. The tarball install records that it cannot see an unused peer dependency, because the package imports perfectly well — it just drags something along. That sentence is why `tests/peerDependencies.test.mjs` exists.

### A tuned threshold is not a waived one

Where a gate fires on something legitimate, tune the scope and record the reason — do not raise the threshold to accommodate it. A contract suite constructs a fresh store per test deliberately, so `src/testing/` is excluded from duplication; the rest of the corpus stayed at 0.92% against a 1% threshold rather than the threshold moving. `examples/` is excluded for the same reason: demo blocks share a shape on purpose — composition is what they demonstrate — so token similarity there measures the demo, not a defect.

### Have someone else run the check against real inputs

A check is written from a model of how the thing fails, and that model is the same one its author
used to decide what to check. Its misses are exactly the cases the model does not contain, and
they stay invisible to the author however carefully they re-read it. A second person brings a
different model — which is why looking harder is not a substitute.

Reading the design is not enough. Both defects below were found by running the check against
real inputs, not by reviewing it:

| Proposed check | What running it showed |
|---|---|
| a `PreToolUse` hook matching `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, to keep the primary worktree clean | files written by an MCP server never meet it — [#211](https://github.com/effekt/nubbin/issues/211) |
| a pattern over gate-table rows, to find rows over-claiming their surface | the only two rows stating a surface stated it correctly, so it fired on the honest rows and passed the rest |

Open [`docs/contributing/gates.md`](../../docs/contributing/gates.md) and grep the table for a scope literal to check the second yourself. Both authors had argued against this failure in the same breath as proposing it.

So hand the check to whoever did not design it, to run against the corpus it will meet — the
same standard as seeding a gate, one level up.

**Gate:** none — nothing can tell whether the person seeding a check is the person who wrote it.

### Put the property in the shape, not in a rule someone remembers

A check whose correctness rests on a convention fails silently the first time someone edits around it, and every gate still passes. Put it where the code cannot work without it. `scaffold-issue.mjs` runs its duplicate search *above* the validation a flag softens, so no flag can reach an issue-open unsearched — the invariant is the statement order, not a note asking callers to search first.

Ask what a careless edit would have to do to break the check, and whether anything would notice. Where the answer is "delete a line nobody reads", the property is in the wrong place.

### Check the artifact, not only the source

A gate reading `src/` cannot see what packing, publishing and installing do. Four defects reached the registry with every source gate green. The `release` vitest project reads the packed manifest and then the installed package, and `tests/packageMetadata.test.mjs` reads the package directory, because those are three different questions.

## Checklist

- [ ] The violation was seeded, the gate failed, and the output is in the commit or PR
- [ ] A clean tree still passes after the change
- [ ] Every form the violation can take was seeded, not just the first one
- [ ] What the gate cannot catch is written down
- [ ] Any exclusion names the reason, and the threshold did not move to accommodate it
- [ ] The check asserts on the thing itself, at a defined moment, not on a proxy for it
- [ ] Someone who did not design the check seeded the violation against it
- [ ] The property lives in the code's shape, not in a convention a later edit can drop
- [ ] A repository invariant went into `tests/`; a general-purpose concern went to a pinned tool
