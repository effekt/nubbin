name: worktree
description: Creates an isolated worktree that can run this repository's gates, before editing anything. Use when starting a change, dispatching a file-editing agent, or when check-worktree.mjs refuses an edit.

# Work in a worktree

The primary checkout is shared. Anything left uncommitted there is read by every other session as
though it were committed, and a `git reset` or `git checkout` by whoever is driving destroys an
agent's uncommitted edits with no error on either side.

`scripts/check-worktree.mjs` refuses edits outside a usable worktree. This is how to get one.

## Create it

```bash
git worktree add -b <branch> .worktrees/<name> origin/main
```

| Part | Why |
|---|---|
| `.worktrees/<name>` | Gitignored, and on the same disk as the work. A path under `/tmp` is swept with uncommitted work still in it |
| `origin/main` | The local `main` may be behind, or checked out by another worktree |

## The setup happens on its own

`.githooks/post-checkout` installs the new worktree and then builds the packages in it, so there
is no command to chain and nothing to remember. It fires on creation only — git passes a null
previous HEAD for `worktree add` and `clone`, and a real one for an ordinary branch switch.

The build is there because an installed tree still cannot run its own gates: every package
resolves its siblings' types from `dist/`, so a typecheck or a package suite on an unbuilt tree
fails naming a missing module rather than a missing build. The turbo cache is shared across
worktrees of one clone, so the second worktree restores what the first built.

**`core.hooksPath` is relative, so git resolves it against the directory the command ran in.**
Creating a worktree from tree A runs A's copy of this hook, not the new tree's — which is why a
change to the hook has to be tested by creating a worktree *from* the tree that carries it.

It has to happen, which is why it is a hook rather than an instruction. Git hooks live in the
common directory, so a fresh worktree inherits `pre-commit`, `commit-msg` and `pre-push`, and they
fire — invoking `pnpm exec lefthook`, which resolves from the worktree's own `node_modules`.
Without it the commit aborts with `Command "lefthook" not found`: nothing unchecked lands, but the
message names no gate and no fix, and the reflex it invites is `--no-verify`, which turns a
fail-closed crash into a silent bypass.

A post-checkout hook cannot fail a checkout, so a failed install is printed loudly rather than
blocking. Read what `git worktree add` printed; if it says the install failed, run it by hand
before editing anything. `touch .git/SKIP_INSTALL_HOOK` disables it.

## Confirm before editing

```bash
node scripts/check-worktree.mjs
# ✅ Worktree usable — linked worktree <name>, lefthook installed.
```

Then watch a gate reject something, rather than assuming the install fixed them. Append a range
specifier to a manifest, which `syncpack` refuses, stage it, and watch the commit be
turned away:

```bash
git add package.json && git commit -m "test(repo): seeded violation"
# ❌ pinned-deps rejects the range; the commit does not land
git checkout -- package.json
```

A worktree whose gates have never been seen to fail is a worktree trusting them on their word.

## A new file under `.claude/skills/` needs an allowlist

`.gitignore` carries `/.claude/skills/*` and one negation per repository-local skill. A skill
added without its `!` line is silently untracked: `git add -A` stages nothing and reports nothing,
and the commit lands without it. This file was lost that way once, leaving
`check-worktree.mjs` telling agents to use a skill that was not there.

## Dispatching an agent

An agent that edits files gets its own worktree, named for its task, and is told to work there and
nowhere else. Its first instruction is the install, because every tool in the tree fails
confusingly until it has run.

An agent that only reads, or only writes to a scratchpad, needs none — it cannot collide.

## When finished

```bash
git worktree remove .worktrees/<name>   # --force if it holds untracked build output
git branch -D <branch>                  # only once the work has landed
```

`git worktree remove` refuses while a branch is checked out elsewhere, which is why
`gh pr merge --delete-branch` reports a failure to delete the local branch and merges anyway.

## Checklist

- [ ] The worktree is under `.worktrees/`, branched from `origin/main`
- [ ] `git worktree add` printed an install that succeeded, or it was run by hand
- [ ] `node scripts/check-worktree.mjs` passes
- [ ] A seeded violation was watched to fail before trusting the hooks
- [ ] A new skill directory was allowlisted in `.gitignore`, and `git status` confirms it is tracked
