// Repository files a document names inside a code span but that do not exist.
//
// `tests/documentationStructure.test.mjs` verifies that links and anchors resolve. A filename in a
// code span is neither, so `commitlint.config.js` sat in three documents — including the rule
// instructing people to reference it — while the file is `commitlint.config.mjs`. A pointer to the
// wrong filename is worse than the stale list it replaced, because it reads as authoritative.
//
// A module rather than logic inside the test, because `scaffold-issue.mjs` asks the same question
// of an issue draft that is not in the tree at all. Nine open issues cite a `docs/decisions.md`
// that became a directory, because no gate reads an issue body — and the draft has to be checked
// by the same rules the tree is, not by a second copy of them.
