// Refuses an edit to the primary worktree, and a linked worktree whose gates cannot run.
//
// Two failures, one root. An agent editing the shared tree mutates files another session is
// reading: two builders in one session reported reasoning around an uncommitted
// `.claude/rules/planning.md` they could not distinguish from committed state, and one changed
// what it wrote because of it. A linked worktree created without an install fails differently
// and worse — git hooks live in the common directory so they fire, but `pnpm exec lefthook`
// has no runner, so the commit aborts with `Command "lefthook" not found`. That names nothing
// an agent can act on, and the reflex it invites is `--no-verify`, which is the one response
// that turns a fail-closed crash into a silent bypass.
//
// Its authority stops at this repository. A scratchpad outside any checkout and a file in an
// unrelated repository are both none of its business, and it said so by crashing before.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-worktree.mjs [path...] [--check]
//        node scripts/check-worktree.mjs --hook     (PreToolUse, reads JSON on stdin)
