// Reports what is sitting uncommitted in the primary worktree, however it got there.
//
// `check-worktree.mjs` refuses the Write, Edit and MultiEdit tool calls, which is a mechanism.
// Anything reaching the filesystem another way never meets it: a `>` redirect inside a shell
// command, an MCP server writing beside whatever it drives, a build step, a test fixture.
// Untracked files still appeared in the primary tree while that hook was active throughout.
// This check asks the outcome question instead, so the route stops mattering.
//
// It reports and never blocks, in both modes, because it cannot see *which* session wrote a
// file. A driver with legitimate uncommitted work trips it, and blocking on that would be a
// refusal roughly every time it fired — the only escape from which is switching the hook off,
// taking the working refusal with it.
//
// The two modes ask deliberately different questions. At dispatch, a modified tracked file
// matters as much as an untracked one: a subagent reading `.claude/rules/planning.md` cannot
// tell an uncommitted edit from committed state, and reasons from it either way. At pre-push,
// only untracked files are reported, because whoever is pushing can cheaply gitignore or remove
// a stray artifact, while a modified tracked file belongs to whoever is editing it and is theirs
// alone to resolve.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-primary-tree.mjs [--check]
//        node scripts/check-primary-tree.mjs --hook   (PreToolUse on Agent|Task, JSON on stdin)
