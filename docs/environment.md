# Agent environment

Most of this repository was written by coding agents, and the tooling they run under changes what
they produce. An agent with an accessibility engine attached finds contrast failures; the same
agent without one ships them. Recording the environment is the difference between a contributor
reproducing a result and wondering why they cannot.

Two things are tracked separately, for the same reason `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed and
`node_modules` is not:

| Layer | Tracked | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **References** — what to install, from where, at what version | `skills-lock.json` and this file | Small, ours to publish, and enough to rebuild the set |
| **Content** — the skills and plugins themselves | Ignored (`.agents/`, `.claude/skills/*`), or outside the repository entirely (`~/.claude/plugins`) | Third-party work. Not ours to redistribute, and skills arrive as symlinks git would follow |

## Language toolchain

Node 24 (`.nvmrc`) and pnpm, pinned by `packageManager` in `package.json`. Neither is optional:
the gates import TypeScript, and every git hook shells out to `pnpm`.

```bash
nvm install && nvm use          # reads .nvmrc
corepack enable pnpm            # activates the pinned pnpm
pnpm install                    # sets core.hooksPath and installs the hooks via `prepare`
```

`prepare` points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`, which is stored in the common git directory and
so covers every worktree made afterwards. That directory holds one tracked hook — `post-checkout`,
which installs a worktree as it is created and builds its packages — beside lefthook's generated
shims, which are ignored.

**`lefthook install` must be passed `--force` under a custom `core.hooksPath`.** Without it, it
prints a target line, writes nothing, and `prepare` swallows the exit code — every git hook in the
repository would be silently absent while the install looked entirely normal.

`pnpm install` on an already-current tree is a no-op and does not re-run `prepare`, so a hook
deleted by hand is not restored by running it again.

If a git hook reports `pnpm: command not found`, the toolchain is not on the PATH for that
shell rather than missing.

## Plugins

Installed with `claude plugin install <name>@<marketplace>`. There is no lockfile for them, and
that is deliberate: the one that existed compared a recorded set against `~/.claude/plugins`,
which a runner does not have, so its only reachable path in CI was the one that read nothing and
exited 0. `claude plugin list` on a contributor's machine answers the same question honestly.

Why any of it is there is the part no listing gives you, so: three of these change what an
agent *produces*, and the rest change how fast it gets there. A browser driver and an
accessibility engine mean contrast failures and missing landmarks get found rather than
shipped. A documentation fetcher means library APIs come from the library instead of from
training data. Design and writing skills change the shape of what gets written — a page built
with one does not resemble the same page built without it, and that difference is why the set
is recorded rather than left to whoever is at the keyboard.

A marketplace being present is not the same as a plugin being installed from it. Browsing a
marketplace repository shows skills that will not load until the plugin carrying them is
installed.

## Skills

From `vercel-labs/agent-skills`, recorded in `skills-lock.json` with a content hash each.
Reinstall them with the skills CLI. **The lockfile is the authority on which ones** — naming
them here would give a reader two lists to reconcile, and the one in prose is the one nobody
updates.

**A skill is a directory, not a file.** `SKILL.md` is the entry point, and the `rules/*.md`,
`references/` and `AGENTS.md` beside it are loaded into an agent's context the same way its body
is — one skill here carries 156 files. The hash covers all of them, each under its own relative
path, so a rename and a moved paragraph both register. Hashing the entry point alone covered 7
of the 298 files installed, and appending an instruction to a `rules/*.md` file passed as
"matches, name and content".

`tests/skillsLock.test.mjs` fails where the lockfile and the installed set disagree in either
direction. Without it the lockfile is a claim about a machine no reader can see: an entry nobody
installed sends a contributor after a skill the work never used, and an installed skill missing
from the lockfile is a result nobody else can reproduce.

Where no skills are installed — a fresh clone, and CI — that comparison cannot run, and vitest
reports it as *skipped* rather than passed. What still runs anywhere is the half needing no disk:
the lockfile parses, and every entry carries the fields a reinstall reads. A `skills-lock.json`
replaced with `{ this is not valid json` used to exit 0 on every CI run under a tick describing a
content hash nothing had computed.

`pnpm skills:record` rewrites the lockfile from what is installed. The first-party `skills` CLI
writes the same file without `contentHash`, and cannot stand in: `skills experimental_install`
against a lockfile whose recorded hash had been corrupted installed anyway and rewrote the hash to
match upstream, so it records a fetch rather than constraining one.

**They install into the project directory** — content under `.agents/skills/`, symlinked from
`.claude/skills/`. Both are ignored. Check `git status` after installing one: three hundred
untracked files appearing at the repository root is the expected shape, and none of them belong
in a commit.

## What this repository provides itself

Committed, and loaded automatically:

| Path | What it does |
|---|---|
| `.claude/rules/*` | Judgment no gate encodes. Auto-load by path glob, so only the relevant ones cost context |
| `.claude/skills/decision` | Recording a decision so it survives — cause, reason, decision, and what it beat |
| `.claude/agents/*` | Named agents with a fixed model: `builder`, `adversary`, `scout` |
| `.claude/settings.json` | The `PostToolUse` chain — `hook-check-file.mjs`, which runs the per-file gates and the `repo` test project, then prompt reviewers judging what no gate can encode |

The reviewers are read when a session starts. A session that began before they existed runs
without them, and no reload command reaches them — restart to pick them up.

## Reproducing it

```bash
nvm install && nvm use
corepack enable pnpm && pnpm install

pnpm run skills:install       # rebuilds every skill in skills-lock.json, digest-checked first
```

Then **restart the session** so the hooks load. A plugin or hook enabled part-way through a
session is not wired for the rest of it, and nothing reports that while it is happening.

`skills:install` fetches each skill's directory from the source the lockfile names and **verifies
the digest before writing anything**. A skill whose upstream has moved since the lockfile was
written is reported and skipped, leaving whatever you already had in place — writing it and
reporting afterwards is how an agent ends up running instructions nobody recorded. The skills that
do verify still install, so one moved upstream does not leave you with none.

`--check` verifies against upstream and writes nothing at all.

It fetches the default branch, because entries record a source and a path but no commit, so a
*past* state is not reachable — [#165](https://github.com/effekt/nubbin/issues/165) is that.

None of this is required to read the design or open an issue. It is required to reproduce a
result — and to have the gates catch, on your machine, what they catch here.
