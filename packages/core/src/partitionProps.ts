/**
 * Splits validated props by `ui.fields[path].data`: absent means static and the value freezes
 * into `props`; `{ revalidate }` means the value is discarded and a hole records
 * how the field resolves at render. The split is by the full dotted path the hint names, so
 * `cta.label` takes that one leaf and the rest of `cta` stays frozen — the same vocabulary
 * `setAtPath` uses to fill the hole back in at render. Iterating hint paths rather than value
 * keys is what makes a nested hint reachable; a hint naming a path the value does not carry
 * takes nothing and is ignored here rather than invented.
