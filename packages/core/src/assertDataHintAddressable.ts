/**
 * A `data` hint turns its field into a hole resolved at render, and a hole addresses one
 * object field — `[]` names every member of an array, so it has no single target. A dotted
 * path is legal: `cta.label` is one object field, and the compiler takes that leaf alone.
 *
 * Two `data` hints whose paths nest are refused for the same reason: a hole over `cta` and a
 * hole over `cta.label` write to one value with no defined order of application. Both checks
 * run at registration, where the developer who wrote the hint sees the error instead of a
 * visitor.
