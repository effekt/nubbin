 * Compiles a fixture, writes the artifact, then moves the pointer **through the running server**.

 * `publishFixture.ts` calls `demoStore.publish` directly, which is correct before a build. This
 * cannot: `revalidatePath` only invalidates the cache of the process that runs it, so publishing
 * from here would move the pointer while the server kept serving its cached copy — the store and
 * the page would disagree, and the publish-without-deploy claim would look false when it is not.
 *
 * `registry`, the compile-side one — never `blockRegistry`, which has no `fingerprint()` and is
 * what the render path uses.
