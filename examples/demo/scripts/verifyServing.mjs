// Proves, against a running `next start`, the three claims Phase 2.11 exists to settle: a route
// published after the build serves without a deploy, unpublishing makes it a server 404, and the
// two hole kinds refresh on their declared schedules.
//
// Every assertion reads the served bytes. A pointer in the store says nothing about what the
// server returns — `revalidatePath` invalidates only the process that runs it, which is why
// `publishLive.ts` publishes over HTTP and why this script cannot import the store to check.
//
// Run it against a built server: `pnpm build && pnpm --filter demo fixtures:publish &&
// pnpm --filter demo build && pnpm --filter demo start`, then `pnpm --filter demo serve:verify`.
//
// Runs every assertion, prints each with what it measured, then exits non-zero if any failed.
// All of them run even after one fails: a single FAIL is usually a broken probe rather than a
// broken system, and the other six are what tell you which.
