/**
 * `jsx` is the load-bearing line. Next requires `"jsx": "preserve"` in `tsconfig.json`, and Vite
 * reads and honours it — without this, the block components reach the module graph with their JSX
 * untransformed and every suite that imports one fails to parse.
 *
 * `include` states the surface rather than inheriting it, and names both extensions. A block's
 * render test is written in `.tsx`, and a pattern that ends at `.ts` collects none of them — the
 * suite reports success having scanned nothing.
 *
 * `environment` is a DOM for every file, not only the render ones: the alternative is a per-file
 * directive, which is the same silent-omission shape as the glob above.
 *
 * `globals` is what registers Testing Library's `afterEach(cleanup)`. Without it a second
 * `render` in one file leaves the first tree mounted and every `getByRole` finds two.
 *
 * Three projects, because they answer about different things. `unit` reads only files in this
 * package and is what `pnpm test` runs. `guardrail` reads the committed artifact store — state
 * whose contents no task hash has any reason to see — so it is invoked directly by
 * `pnpm guardrail` at the workspace root and is registered as no turbo task, exactly as the
 * `release` project is at the root for the same reason.
 *
 * `e2e` starts a real server and asserts on served bytes, so its verdict depends on a port, a
 * build and a store rather than on the files it reads. It is invoked by `pnpm e2e` and is no
 * turbo task, for the same reason as `guardrail`: a cache that replayed it would be reporting a
 * pass about a server that never ran.
