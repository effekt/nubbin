// `skills-lock.json` is the only committed record of which third-party skills this repository is
// worked on with. That makes it a claim about an environment nobody can see from the repository,
// and an unverified claim drifts three ways: an entry for a skill nobody installed sends a
// contributor to fetch something the work never used, an installed skill missing from the lockfile
// is a result nobody else can reproduce, and a skill whose text has changed under a name that still
// matches is the one that changes what an agent produces while looking identical.
//
// Two halves, because they need different things. The lockfile has to parse and every entry has to
// carry the fields a reinstall reads — true on any machine, and the half that was missing when a
// `skills-lock.json` replaced with `{ this is not valid json` exited 0 on every CI run. The
// comparison against disk needs `.agents/skills`, which is gitignored, so a runner has none: that
// half is skipped rather than passed, because a skipped test says so and a tick does not.
