// Every publishable package is one release-please releases, at the version it is actually at.
//
// Both halves fail silently. A package added under `packages/` that nobody adds to
// `release-please-config.json` is never versioned, never changelogged and never tagged — and
// nothing says so, because release-please releases what it was told about and reports success. A
// `.release-please-manifest.json` entry that disagrees with the manifest beside it is worse: that
// file is what release-please treats as the last released version, so a wrong entry computes the
// next version from a version that never shipped, and looks for a tag that does not exist.
//
// The linked group is asserted too. `linked-versions` is what makes the four packages share a
// version, and it matches on component names — a package missing from `components` keeps its own
// version line while the rest move together, which reads as a release-please bug rather than as a
// configuration gap.
