# Nubbin

**Your components. Their pages.**

A page builder that lives inside your codebase. Developers curate a set of blocks in code;
non-developers compose pages from them. The composition is data, the contract is code, and
publishing compiles a document into an immutable artifact — no bundler, no deploy, no second
source of truth.

Nubbin is deliberately not a general-purpose CMS. It answers one question: how does someone who
does not write code publish pages from components your application already owns?

```bash
npm install @nubbin/core
```

![A terminal publishing a page while a browser shows it change: the card shelf and the changes
feed trade places, revert, and one card is rewritten — each edit a single nubbin publish, with no
deploy and no restart](docs/media/publish-loop.svg)

Every frame of that is a real session: the same page at the same scroll offset, `moveNode` and
`setNodeProp` applied before publishing, and a compatibility check refusing a block version that
four live pages depend on.

The packages are published; the studio is not built yet — see
[Status](#status). A block declares its schema once, and each field decides for itself whether
it freezes at publish or stays live:

```ts
// hero.schema.ts — sub-schemas are extracted so blocks can share them
export const heroSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  price: z.number(),
  cta: ctaSchema,
});

// hero.block.ts
export const heroBlock = defineBlock({
  name: "Hero",
  schema: heroSchema,
  component: Hero,        // props are InferProps<typeof heroSchema> — no second definition
  version: 1,
  slots: {},
});

// Editing hints live on the catalog, the serializable half that carries no components.
export const catalog = defineCatalog({
  Hero: {
    schema: heroSchema,
    ui: {
      fields: {
        // `title` carries no `data` hint — static, frozen at compile. The default.
        price: { data: { revalidate: 60 } },  // your resolver fills it. Per field, not per block.
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Compiling that document freezes what's static and leaves the rest as a typed hole — the
artifact never carries the schema, only the outcome of validating against it:

```ts
// one node of the compiled Artifact — see docs/domain-model.md
{
  id: "n1",
  block: "Hero",
  props: { title: "Sale ends Friday", cta: { label: "Shop now", href: "/sale" } },
  holes: { price: { revalidate: 60 } },
}
```

## Why

A page builder holds two contracts: what a block will accept, and what an author composed.
Nubbin puts the first in your repository, shipping atomically with the component that reads
it, and the second in a database, where it can change hourly without a build.

That single split is the whole design, and everything below follows from it. Put the schema in
a database instead and you inherit two environments that drift, tooling to reconcile them, and
a cache to survive a round trip on every render.

| Property | What it buys |
|---|---|
| **Schema in code** | Props are inferred from the schema. There is no second definition to drift. |
| **Content as data** | One store, versions instead of environments. Promotion is a pointer move, not a copy. |
| **Immutable artifacts** | Content-addressed, cached forever, rolled back by pointer. Nothing to invalidate at the store; the page cache drops one route on publish. |
| **No deploy to publish** | Compiling validates and serializes. Only a *code* change needs a build. |
| **Precise code-splitting** | An artifact names the blocks a page uses, so the hundredth block costs other pages nothing. |
| **Not in your render path** | Publishing produces an artifact your application serves on its own. A Nubbin outage cannot take down a page that is already published. |
| **Bring your own storage** | Storage, auth and validation are adapters. Artifacts live where you put them — object storage, a database, your deployment output. |
| **Portable core** | `@nubbin/core` depends on nothing but Standard Schema, and runs in a browser, a worker, a server or a CI step. |

Published pages do not call Nubbin. The application reads immutable artifacts from storage you
chose, and the artifact holds the *result* of validating against the schema rather than a
reference back to it. Nubbin is needed to change a page, not to serve one.

## Status

**The packages are complete and the studio is not started.**

| Package | State |
|---|---|
| `@nubbin/core` | `defineBlock`, `defineCatalog`, `createRegistry`, `compile`, the document operations (`addNode`, `removeNode`, `moveNode`, `setNodeProp`), `checkCompatibility`, `checkRollback` |
| `@nubbin/store-fs` | A pointer-per-route store, passing a contract suite a third-party adapter can run |
| `@nubbin/next` | Read and write paths — resolve, prebuild params, publish and unpublish |
| `@nubbin/react` | The renderer, the block registry, and hole resolution |
| `@nubbin/cli` | The publish path from a terminal — compile, publish, unpublish, rollback, status, check |

`npm view @nubbin/core dist-tags` is the current answer for what a plain install resolves to. Everything is tested against real
schemas rather than mocks, and a build gate fails on any `node:` or framework import inside
`core`, so the claim that it runs anywhere is checked rather than asserted.

The studio runs against the demo: it reads the catalog, previews a draft, edits a field, and
publishes the artifact. [`apps/studio/README.md`](apps/studio/README.md) is its current extent.

The milestone that could invalidate the whole approach has run — five real pages authored as
fixtures against real blocks, with no editor. Weighing the evidence it produced is
[#70](https://github.com/effekt/nubbin/issues/70).

The architecture came first, with the decisions and the alternatives each one beat. It has
been through one adversarial review, which falsified the live postMessage preview and the
single-manifest publish; both were redesigned. That is a reason to trust the design more than
an unreviewed one, not a reason to treat it as finished — [the open
questions](https://github.com/effekt/nubbin/issues/15) are the parts known not to be settled.

Every gate runs on every commit, including the ones that inspect the codebase rather than
trusting a declared convention — package boundaries, dead code, type coverage, and whether a
published package actually installs.

The [roadmap](https://github.com/effekt/nubbin/issues/14) sequences the build. Its first
milestone is deliberately not a feature — it exists to falsify the project's own thesis, by
authoring real pages against real blocks with no editor at all, before anything expensive is
built on top of that assumption.

Every package carries a generated [`CATALOG.md`](packages/core/CATALOG.md) — one row per
file, naming the export, its kind, and its own first line of documentation.

## Contributing

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first — it documents the invariants and routes to the rest; the
gates are in [`docs/gates.md`](docs/gates.md).
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers setup and what's worth contributing before any
code exists.

The short version: one unit per file, schemas composed rather than nested, every dependency
pinned, and every nameable step extracted. Quality gates are enforced rather than suggested,
including on prose — documentation rots faster than code and shows no symptoms.

Disagreement about the design is more useful than agreement right now — the
[open questions](https://github.com/effekt/nubbin/issues/15) are where to start.
