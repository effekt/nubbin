// Agent attribution on a commit distinguishes nothing when every commit carries it, and this
// repository's root already says who works here — `.claude/`, the agent definitions, the skills.
// The trailer is noise on a permanent artifact, so it is rejected at authoring time rather than
// left to whoever remembers. Co-authorship as such is untouched: the patterns name agents.
//
// Pull request bodies are the same decision and a different mechanism; `commitlint` never sees
// one, so `AGENTS.md` carries that half.
